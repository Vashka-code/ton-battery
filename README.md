# Project for Tonkeeper competition for Web Developers

## Selected Technologies: Vue 3, FSD Architecture, TypeScript

I decided to combine two useful endeavors into one: try out the architecture in a new project, while continuing to work with Vue 3. I am fully aware that these technologies are unnecessary for this task, but theoretically, if we consider this site as a foundation and on its basis we can efforts to create a well-supported and easily scalable front-end application without thinking about the approach and architecture.

# ./

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
